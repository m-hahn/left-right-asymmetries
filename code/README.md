* `run5All_...` scripts run the LSTM-based predictor of syntactic states on all languages

* `results.tsv` contains the results (assembled by `assembleResults.tsv`)

* `analyze.R` contains some code for analyzing the results

* There is some code for the MI between the label and left/right participants of the dependency in some other scripts (mainly `testLeftRightEntUniHDCond3FilterMIWord3.py`). I don't have code set up for collecting results across languages.
